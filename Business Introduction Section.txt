"I have been working on gathering investment with the aim to open a pub in England, I have been pitching the idea for some time now and my investors believe I am indeed the man for the job. I am however left with one final crucial decision that needs to be assessed and presented to the investors before I receive the final sign off... I need to qualify the best location for my pub.

As part of the process I will be attempting to create a ranking system based on local amenities and user/customer reviews with the Foursquare API."
